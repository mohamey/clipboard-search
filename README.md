# Clipboard Search
This is a simple python script that performs a google search on the contents of your clipboard. I made it because I was tired of copying error messages into google chrome.

## Requirements
This script requires python3 and pip.

## Set up
This set up *only* performs a google search, it does not listen for keyboard input. Since I use gnome I just created a keyboard shortcut that runs this script. A shortcut listener may be added in the future.
